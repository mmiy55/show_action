# Show Action
A simple chrome extension designed to improve accessibility for color blind users.

Version 1 is focused on "Call for Action": 
A lot of the time we use font color or font weight to denote links and buttons, this may be not ideal for color blind user.

#1 Underline links
The extension will underline all the anchor text to make it easy to distinguish from regular text.

#2 Use border to emphasize the buttons
Use border around buttons to make them stand out
